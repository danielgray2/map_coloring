# How to get up and running
- Install this repository
- Create a virtualenv (See [here](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) for more info)
- Activate the virtualenv and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the command `python3 main.py g` The `g` will tell the program to generate the maps and save them to a file called `map_data.p` and display your maps
- To display your maps again, simply run `python3 main.py`, and you it will pull your pre-generated maps into an array and then display them
